#Discogs Inventory Images

Discogs does not allow one to assocaite images with an inventory item.  This chrome plugin will add an extra row on ones inventory page (https://www.discogs.com/sell/manage) in which one can drag files and they will be uploaded to a dropbox folder, associated by inventory ID.

Although this plugin provides no value to a consumer, it allows one to keep track of images for a particular record.
